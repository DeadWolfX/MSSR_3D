To run the example, you only need to execute Jupyter Lab in the project folder and open the "Example.ipynb" file, which is a Jupyter Notebook. To test it, you can either run it directly or modify the image path to the one you want to analyze and change the parameters "psf","order","amplification", and "interpolation ".

The next files are examples to try the code:
  -Ts_568_0_5um_confocal.tif
